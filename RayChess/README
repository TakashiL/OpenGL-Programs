Q: How to run the program?
A:
0. To create the executable, run "make".

1. run ./raychess -u 3 +s +l +r.

------------------------------------
This is a program for bonus problem (a). To get the scene in
chess_scene.bmp, you have to run command './raychess -u 3 +s +l +r'.
I have only implemented problem (a), and there is no speedup techniques.
