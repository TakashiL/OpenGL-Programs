Q: How to run the program?
A:
0. To create the executable, run "make".

1. A few example commands:
./raycast -d 5 +s +l
or
./raycast -u 5 +s +l +r +c
or
./raycast -u 3 +s +l +r +f +c +p

Q: Which features you have implemented?
A: This program implemented all features required. For feature 6 and 7, it may take
a long time to run, set step_max to 3 to shorten the running time.

Q: Images and corresponding commands?
A: There are two images. You can find them in the folder 'images'.
The 'default.bmp' is created with command: ./raycast -d 5 +s +l
The 'mine.bmp' is created with command: ./raycast -u 5 +s +l +r +c

Please note that stochastic ray and supersampling are also implemented, but not
showed in the 'mine.bmp'.
