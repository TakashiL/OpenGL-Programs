# Ray tracing

## How to Run the Game:
* Use command "make" to create the executable file.
* Use command "./raycast -d 0" to create the simplest image.
* The most complicated command is "./raycat -u step_max +s +l +r +f +c +p".

## Parameter detail:
* +s: add shadows
* +l: add reflections
* +r: add refractions
* +c: add chess board
* +f: add stochastic rays: will be time-consuming, set step_max to 3
* +p: add supersampling: will be time-consuming, set step_max to 3

## Images:
* There are two images. You can find them in the folder 'images'.
* The 'default.bmp' is created with command: ./raycast -d 5 +s +l
* The 'mine.bmp' is created with command: ./raycast -u 5 +s +l +r +c
* To save image during running, press 's'.
